GABI - GESTALT Analysis using Bayesian Inference in BEAST2:
==================================

In this repository, we develop a BEAST 2 package to estimate time-scaled lineage trees and cell population dynamics from GESTALT data, implementing the phylogenetic likelihood in [GAPML](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9387344/).


Building from source
--------------------

The default target in the provided [Apache ANT](http://ant.apache.org)
build script can be used to build the BEAST 2 package from scratch.
The package archive will be left in the `dist/` directory.
